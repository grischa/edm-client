# edm-client

A list of small things to work on:

* TODO: proxy settings parsing in edmKit/networking.ts, integrate with connection.ts
* TODO: Prompt for token if none given, with web address where to get one
* TODO: Command to write default config file template
* TODO: Package app as "edm" instead of "node app", possible pack it into one file if possible
